**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project is designed to automate the generation of formatted PDF reports from data read from a text file. The primary objective is to demonstrate how Python can be used to read, analyze, and present data in a structured and professional PDF format. By leveraging libraries such as FPDF, the project automates the process of creating reports, which can be customized based on the data provided in the input file. The output is a well-structured, easy-to-read PDF report, making this tool ideal for business, academic, and personal applications where regular report generation is needed.

**TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED**

**1. Python:**
Python is the main programming language used for this project. Its simplicity and extensive ecosystem of libraries make it a perfect choice for this task. Python is used for reading the input data, processing it, and generating the PDF output.
**2. FPDF Library:**
The FPDF library is used to generate the PDF reports in this project. FPDF is a free and open-source Python library that allows for the creation of PDF documents from scratch. It provides features for formatting text, adding headers/footers, and working with tables and images, among other things.
**Installation:** To install the FPDF library, use the following command:

```bash
pip install fpdf
